f.conv2d_2 --> tensor_with_id777 --> in place relu_1 --> tensor_with_id777 --> f.conv2d_2 --> tensor_with_id776


f.conv2d_2 will see that f.conv2d_2 tensor_with_id777 is comming from the operation relu_1 and f.conv2d_2 sow i shold fixe this.
fixing in place operations.

to fixe this i can update a counter for the same tensor when its produced again by difrent operation

sow it will be apeer in the the first 
   as output with                    as output 
   counter = 0                       with counter = 0
f.conv2d_2 --> tensor_with_id777 --> in place relu_1

then  it will be apeer in the secend production by 
   as output with                    as output 
   counter = 1                       with counter = 1
in place relu_1 --> tensor_with_id777 --> f.conv2d_2

this informations must be used in the tensor info
